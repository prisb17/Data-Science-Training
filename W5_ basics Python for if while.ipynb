If we forget to do this then the program will crash when we try to carry out arithmetic on the `mark` variable.\n",

This is because the `range` function generates a sequence of numbers from zero to one less than its argument. Thus, `range(3)` generates the numbers 0, 1, 2; `range(12)` generates 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 10, 11, and so on.

    "#Exercise: Marathon Times\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an exercise that will get you thinking about how to manipulate numbers. It is usual, when working with times, to convert real-world timings into a figure in seconds as this makes comparisons between two times much simpler. Given that there are 3600 seconds in an hour, write an algorithm that takes the start and finish times of a marathon runner in the form hh:mm:ss, converts them to a time in seconds, subtracts the start seconds from the finish seconds to give an elapsed time, and then converts this elapsed time in seconds back into a real world time of the form hh:mm:ss for display. For example, say I started a marathon at 09:05:45 and finished at 13:01:06, my start time would be 09 $\\times$ 3600 + 05 $\\times$ 60 + 45 = 32,400 + 300 + 45 = 32,745 seconds. My finish time would be 46,800 + 60 + 06 = 46,866 seconds. My race time would then be 46,866 - 32,745 = 14,121 seconds. This comes to 03:55:21. The real problem here is how did I get 03:55:21 from 14,121? The solution is related to the change-giving problem from Chapter 3 in the book.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint** You will need to use integer arithmetic here. Remember the `//` operator gives you the _whole_ number of times one value goes into another, and the `%` operator gives you the remainder of that divison. For example:\n",
    "````\n",
    "52 // 24 == 2\n",

    "# Further Practice: Codingbat\n",
    "To get more practice with Python, visit the [CodingBat](https://codingbat.com/python \"CodingBat Python practice\") website where you can access a collection of short Python coding challenges. Start with the [warmup](https://codingbat.com/python/Warmup-1 \"Warmup exercises\") exercises and then proceed as you wish. all the code can be entered and tested directly on the CodingBat website, and it tells you when you have successfully completed the challenges.\n",

    "There are two principal advantages to this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   Learning to program requires **LOTS** of repeated practice. You need to build up your repertoire of Python techniques so that you don't have to continually reach for your course notes to do basic things.\n",
    "2.   Secondly, employers are increasingly using exercises of the kind found on sites like CodingBat as part of their staff selection and recruitment process. There's no better way to see if someone has the basics of programming down pat than asking them to complete a series of small programming challenges. Therefore, engaging with the CodingBath exercises will help you to become familiar with the kinds of challenges you might face at a future job interview.\n",
